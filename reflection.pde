Part A - Mark (5/5)
-----------------------------

Comments, indentation, naming, structure of code, includsion of Readme and Reflection.

<just a mark needed here>


Part B - Mark (10/10)
-----------------------------
line 15 - draw() 
line 10 - setup()

Setup and draw are fully working for me, so I score myself excellent 100%. 10/10

Part C - Mark (9/10)
-----------------------------
Use of if statements:

line 52 (with following else statements) to determine robot head position
line 84 (with following else statement) to determine robot eye position
line 145 (with nested if, and with following else statements) to determine arm element positions and behaviours
line 195 (with following else statements) to determine leg element positions and behaviours
line 240 (with following else statements) to determine additional leg element positions and behaviours
line 287 (with following else staement) to define conditions for robots walking movement
line 310 (with nested if)  to define conditions of antenna wave effect
line 371 to define limit of when method can be used
line 383 (with nested if and with following else statements) to define timing of text displayed in sketch
line 410 (with extensive nested ifs and else statements) to define conditions of clicking behaviour and JOptionPane dialogs

I have multiple if statements, with multiple branches. I have multiple nested ifs. No ifs inside of for loops though, so I'd give myself 90%.

Part D - Mark (20/20)
-----------------------------
Use of loops:

for loops used on:
line 43 (with a nested for loop) to create backround number effect
line 85 (with a nested for loop) to create the eyelights effect
line 92 (with a nested for loop) to adjust the eyelights to account for x value bug mentioned in the readme tab
line 111 to create vent details on robot body door
line 134 ro create vent details on opened robot body door


use of while loop on:
line 200 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 210 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 222 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 232 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 245 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 255 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 268 to draw lines on the robot's legs
line 278 to draw lines on the robot's legs

I have multiple instances of for and while loops and nested for loops. I rate this one 100%.

Part F - Mark (18/20)
-----------------------------
Use of Processing methods 

line 24 - mouseX, mouseY
line 152 dist() 
line 410 mousePressed()

Many Processing methods used. Ran out of time to list all the line numbers. 90% (for not completing line numbers)

Part G - Mark (15/15)
-----------------------------
Use of String methods 

line 476 - length()
line 479 - length()
line 484 - length()
line 486 - charAt()
