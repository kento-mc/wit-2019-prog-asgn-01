Brief description of the animation achieved:

I created an interactive robot that walks onto the screen, speaks to the user and interacts by giving 
the user a new, robot-approved, name. The main animations achieved are various reactions of parts of 
the robot to clicking behaviour.

Known bugs/problems:

There are still problems with the validation of user input in the JOptionPane dialog boxes. I didn't have
time work out how to account for all possible user inputs that could crash the program. As long as people 
respond reasonably to the robot's prompts there shouldn't be any issues.

There was a small shift in the x position of some elements when the robot comes to a stop after he initially
walks on screen. I covered this by using if/else statements to shift the affected elements slightly at the 
appropriate point. I would have liked to root out what was causing the shift, but for the sake of moving on
early in the process of building the animations, I opted to just adjust to the bug, rather than fix it.

Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials):

I used this video specifically for figuring out how to use the dist() Processing method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7k5bFQbhG0 
And I watched a lot of the same guy's videos on processing which helped my understanding of using it genearlly.
Any other questions I had were just answered by a quick google search or looking at the Processing reference.
